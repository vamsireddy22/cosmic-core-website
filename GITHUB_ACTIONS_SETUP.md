# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the automated deployment workflows for the CosmicCore Website.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The GitHub Actions are already configured and will work automatically once you push to the main branch.

## 📋 Workflows Overview

### 1. **Automatic Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Pull request to `main` or `master` branch

**What it does:**
- ✅ Type checking
- ✅ Linting
- ✅ Building
- ✅ Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages (only on main branch)

### 2. **Pull Request Validation** (`.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Pull request to `main` or `master` branch

**What it does:**
- ✅ Type checking
- ✅ Linting
- ✅ Building
- ✅ Comments on PR with build status

### 3. **Scheduled Maintenance** (`.github/workflows/scheduled-checks.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

**What it does:**
- ✅ Dependency audit
- ✅ Security checks
- ✅ Outdated package detection

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a PR
   - The PR checks will run automatically
   - Wait for all checks to pass

5. **Merge to main:**
   - Once PR is approved and checks pass
   - Merge to main branch
   - **Website deploys automatically!**

### For Direct Main Branch Updates

1. **Make your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update website"
   ```

2. **Push to main:**

- Check if gh-pages branch exists

## 🔒 Security Features

### Dependency Scanning
- Weekly security audits
- Outdated package detection
- Vulnerability alerts

### Quality Gates
- Type checking required
- Linting must pass
- Build must succeed

## 📈 Benefits
